# King County House Sales - Statistical Analysis (Python)

The project contains initial data and exploratory analysis of some of the variables in the data set, as well as supervised (linear regression) and unsupervised (kmeans clustering) machine learning techniques in order to derive insights. A short time seires analysis was also part of the project.

## Context
King County is located in Washington, USA. It is the most populous county in the state and is located in the western part of Washington, surrounding the city of Seattle. 

King County is known for its diverse geography and long coastline along the Puget Sound. The county is a hub for technology, commerce, and tourism and has a thriving arts and cultural scene, being home to several museums, theaters, and festivals. 

The county is one of three Washington counties that are included in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan statistical area. About two-thirds of King County's 2.3 Mio population lives in Seattle's suburbs.

In this statistical analysis, we will inform the distribution of house prices in King County.

## Initial Questions
These are some of the intitial questions from the start of the project:

- Does the sale price of houses vary with location?
- Are there any patterns in the time of year when houses are sold?
- How does the size of a house relate to its sale price?
- Are houses with more bedrooms and bathrooms generally more expensive?
- Does having a waterfront property affect a house's sale price?
- How does the view of the property affect a house's sale price?
- Does the condition and grade of the house affect its sale price?
- Does the year the house was built and last renovated affect its sale price?
- How does the square footage of the interior living space of a home compare to that of its nearest 15 neighbors?
- How does the grade of a home relate to the square footage above and below ground level?
- How does the number of floors in a home relate to the grade level?
